# Handwritten Text Recognition with CNN + RNN

This project implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to perform handwritten text recognition on grayscale images. The model is trained to recognize sequences of characters in images, such as handwritten words or lines of text.

## Project Overview

The model in this project uses:
- A CNN for feature extraction from input images
- An RNN (Bidirectional LSTM) to recognize sequences of characters
- A character-level tokenizer to convert labels to sequences of integers

The code trains the model to identify character sequences in images and is intended for applications like handwritten word or sentence recognition.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset should be structured as follows:
- Each image file (e.g., `.png`) should have a corresponding text file (`.txt`) with the same name containing the ground truth label.

Example:
dataset/ ├── image1.png ├── image1.txt ├── image2.png ├── image2.txt └── ...


- **Image files** are expected to be grayscale images.
- **Text files** contain the label text for each image.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of:
1. **CNN Layers**: Three convolutional layers for feature extraction.
2. **Bidirectional LSTM Layer**: Processes the extracted features in sequence.
3. **TimeDistributed Dense Layer**: Provides character-level predictions at each timestep.

This structure allows the model to learn and recognize text sequences from the images.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Installation
To install the necessary packages, run:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python-headless numpy
Training the Model
Place your dataset in the dataset folder.
Update the dataset_folder path in the code if necessary:
python
dataset_folder = '/path/to/your/dataset/'
Run the code in your Python environment or Colab to train the model.
Training Parameters
img_height and img_width are set to 64 and 256, respectively.
batch_size is 32, and epochs is 50.
The code tokenizes text labels at the character level and pads them to match the model’s output timesteps.
Save Model and Tokenizer
After training, the model and tokenizer are saved as follows:
handwriting_model.h5: The trained model.
tokenizer.pickle: The tokenizer for decoding predictions.
Usage
To use the trained model:

Load the model and tokenizer:
python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import pickle

model = load_model('/content/handwriting_model.h5')
with open('/content/tokenizer.pickle', 'rb') as handle:
    tokenizer = pickle.load(handle)
Preprocess your input images similarly to how the training images were processed.
Use the model to predict character sequences and decode them using the tokenizer.
Future Improvements
Model Complexity: Implementing additional layers or tuning hyperparameters could improve accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Adding data augmentation techniques could improve generalization.
Attention Mechanism: Incorporating an attention layer may enhance recognition of complex or long text sequences.
Transfer Learning: Experimenting with pre-trained models for feature extraction could enhance performance.
